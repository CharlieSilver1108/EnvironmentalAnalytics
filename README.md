### About:
This is an individual project, completed as an assignment for a Year 1 Module at the University of Exeter, using Python. It was completed using Visual Studio Code.

### The Project Description:
The environmental, economical and societal challenges imposed by the ongoing climate crisis are already imposing significant challenges on governments worldwide. In 2019, carbon emissions originating from road transport (111 MtCO2e) accounted for more than 24% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions. From the total transport-related emissions, 61% ( 68 MtCO2e) were produced by cars and taxis.

As part of the NetZero commitments assumed by the UK government, you were invited to contribute to the AQUA (Air QUality Analytics) platform. The AQUA platform is an air pollution data analytics solution. AQUA users are policy-makers and public servants responsible for monitoring the pollution levels in different areas of the country.

You will implement the analytics routines of the AQUA platform which must generate an array of statistics for different air monitoring stations. More precisely, you will have to implement three modules of the platform:
• Pollution Reporting (PR)
• Mobility Intelligence (MI)
• Real-time Monitoring (RM)

## Other:
There is also a Utilities module included containing useful functions that are used within the other modules
